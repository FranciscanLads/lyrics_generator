# lyrics_generator
A TensorFlow Model that Generates Lyrics.

Natural Language Processing Project.

This is a mini project which tries to generate Coldplay lyrics. 
And later maybe more types of Artists. Accuracy may vary.
First we scrape all the lyrics from azlyrics.com

Then we will try to implement it in a python file.

Required pip installs --> []

1) First we run coldplay_test.py
2) It will save a file with the name coldplay.html
3) Then we run coldplay_scrape.py
4) We save the generated links in the console in an array in another python file.
5) Now we will try to append all of these to a certain file.
